Demo Gallery Notes
* Godenmberg 4 years ago marketing initiative 3 or 4 people
tech support. 
by adding demos, access to Neil. Within 6 months people moved to other roles
DS team does not have capacity to run demo Gallery but someone has to do the job
Jose  > Library Admin with SRE

Issues:
There is no sales or marketing or SRE budget to support Demo gallery
might need to COP (Community of Practice) need to put demos out there
SRE requires to install packages, custom extension, etc (we can do custom extensions)
*SRE says many TSE. Operations, integration with tools and security are major concerns. For example statistica and Spotifre. 
No issues with demo gallery, but statistica requires a virtual machine. main thing is: packages can handled by TSE for demo gallery. Some demos uses statistica.
Hyperconverged analytics. We cant demonstrate statistica integration on the demo gallery. Why not add Statistica as part of TSE? Data function integration. Built models with statistica. 
Statistica component is not a priority. 
Requiers a new VM for Statistica. 
We can do VM and TSE Spotifre. Issue is that both, statistica.
